## Qwitter 

# Background
    Flask is a small and lightweight Python web framework that provides useful tools and features that make creating web applications in Python easier. Flask is a well known python framework used for backend purposes to operate dynamic web pages by using route method. It gives developers flexibility and is a more accessible framework for new developers since you can build a web application quickly using only a single Python file.
    In this project, I have used HTML/CSS and bootstrap for the frontend part and Flask is used to operate backend part.
